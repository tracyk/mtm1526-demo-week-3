<!-- 
loading jQuery from google's CDN is more efficient than downloading into your 'js' folder. it will be served from the google server nearest your user and, if your user has been to another website that also uses Google's CDN, it will be cached 
you will always use the path and not path ui since you want the compressed file unless you are going to devel. jQuery

everything in jQuery is wrapped up in the $() element
related to css example: $('#id') .class dv.p  div > p: first-child, meaning it understands css

<!--it's important that jQuery is above your Javascript file so it gets downloaded and parsed first-->
